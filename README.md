Hi, I’m @krieo
I’m currently learning at UJ my Honours in Computer Sciences specializing in artificial intelligence
**Currently all my repositories are set to private so it shows i don't have much activity going on**
But the few projects i am working on in private include:
1) A 2D unity game that utilizes various techniques in the artificial intelligence domain that allows for procedural world generation and teaching a character how to play a level.
2) A binary classification application that utilizes techniques from complementary neural networks and logistic regression to predict machine failure.
3) A compiler made in the C# programming language that translates a programming language i have created.
4) A pipeline application that facilitates the process from start to finish of a sound matching application, essentially what this project does is that it utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to recognize sounds from a kitchen and try to match them, when a user can upload a sound file and the api will try to match the file to the kitchen sound.
5) A e-commerce website that facilitates that process of catalog, invoices, quotes, credit notes, delivery notes, and statements, as well as keep track of users of the system and offers various report statistics of the day to day tasks.
6) A pet networking application that utilizes tree data structures to enhance my understanding of tree data structures.
7) A Netbeans Java application that was used to enhance my learning of tree data structures and various artificial intelligent search based techniques. 
Currently I have all of these set to private so it shows I have 0 contributions so if you would like to view the repo let me know or if you are looking to hire?
